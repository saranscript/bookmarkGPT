Enhancing Bookmark Organization with Tags

## Introduction
As your bookmark list continues to expand, the challenge of finding the right bookmark becomes increasingly daunting. This project is designed to elevate your bookmark management experience by introducing contextual tags through the power of ChatGPT. This enhancement simplifies the process of searching for and organizing bookmarks.

## Getting Started
1. Start by exporting your Chrome bookmarks and saving them as a file on your local system.
2. Rename the file to "out.html" and copy it to the project directory. Then, install the required dependencies by running "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. The "out.html" file has now been enriched with context. You can now import it back into Chrome.
4. When searching in the address bar, simply prefix your query with a hash tag (#), and Chrome will intelligently suggest related bookmarks.
